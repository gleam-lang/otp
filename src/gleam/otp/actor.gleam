//// This module provides the _Actor_ abstraction, one of the most common
//// building blocks of Gleam OTP programs.
//// 
//// An Actor is a process like any other BEAM process and can be used to hold
//// state, execute code, and communicate with other processes by sending and
//// receiving messages. The advantage of using the actor abstraction over a bare
//// process is that it provides a single interface for commonly needed
//// functionality, including support for the [tracing and debugging
//// features in OTP][erlang-sys].
////
//// Gleam's Actor is similar to Erlang's `gen_server` and Elixir's `GenServer`
//// but differs in that it offers a fully typed interface. This different API is
//// why Gleam uses the name Actor rather than some variation of generic-server.
////
//// [erlang-sys]: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sys.html
////
//// ## Example
////
//// An Actor can be used to create a client-server interaction between an Actor
//// (the server) and other processes (the clients). In this example we have an
//// Actor that works as a stack, allowing clients to push and pop elements.
////
//// ```gleam
//// pub fn main() {
////   // Start the actor with initial state of an empty list, and the
////   // `handle_message` callback function (defined below).
////   // We assert that it starts successfully.
////   // 
////   // In real-world Gleam OTP programs we would likely write wrapper functions
////   // called `start`, `push` `pop`, `shutdown` to start and interact with the
////   // Actor. We are not doing that here for the sake of showing how the Actor 
////   // API works.
////   let assert Ok(my_actor) = actor.start([], handle_message)
//// 
////   // We can send a message to the actor to push elements onto the stack.
////   process.send(my_actor, Push("Joe"))
////   process.send(my_actor, Push("Mike"))
////   process.send(my_actor, Push("Robert"))
//// 
////   // The `Push` message expects no response, these messages are sent purely for
////   // the side effect of mutating the state held by the actor.
////   //
////   // We can also send the `Pop` message to take a value off of the actor's
////   // stack. This message expects a response, so we use `process.call` to send a
////   // message and wait until a reply is received.
////   //
////   // In this instance we are giving the actor 10 milliseconds to reply, if the
////   // `call` function doesn't get a reply within this time it will panic and
////   // crash the client process.
////   let assert Ok("Robert") = process.call(my_actor, Pop, 10)
////   let assert Ok("Mike") = process.call(my_actor, Pop, 10)
////   let assert Ok("Joe") = process.call(my_actor, Pop, 10)
//// 
////   // The stack is now empty, so if we pop again the actor replies with an error.
////   let assert Error(Nil) = process.call(my_actor, Pop, 10)
//// 
////   // Lastly, we can send a message to the actor asking it to shut down.
////   process.send(my_actor, Shutdown)
//// }
//// ```
////
//// Here is the code that is used to implement this actor:
////
//// ```gleam
//// import gleam/erlang/process.{type Subject}
//// import gleam/otp/actor
////
//// // First step of implementing the stack Actor is to define the message type that
//// // it can receive.
//// //
//// // The type of the elements in the stack is not fixed so a type parameter is used
//// // for it instead of a concrete type such as `String` or `Int`.
//// pub type Message(element) {
////   // The `Shutdown` message is used to tell the actor to stop.
////   // It is the simplest message type, it contains no data.
////   Shutdown
//// 
////   // The `Push` message is used to add a new element to the stack.
////   // It contains the item to add, the type of which is the `element`
////   // parameterised type.
////   Push(push: element)
//// 
////   // The `Pop` message is used to remove an element from the stack.
////   // It contains a `Subject`, which is used to send the response back to the
////   // message sender. In this case the reply is of type `Result(element, Nil)`.
////   Pop(reply_with: Subject(Result(element, Nil)))
//// }
//// 
//// // The last part is to implement the `handle_message` callback function.
//// //
//// // This function is called by the Actor for each message it receives.
//// // Actor is single threaded and only does one thing at a time, so it handles
//// // messages sequentially and one at a time, in the order they are received.
//// //
//// // The function takes the message and the current state, and returns a data
//// // structure that indicates what to do next, along with the new state.
//// fn handle_message(
////  message: Message(e),
////  stack: List(e),
//// ) -> actor.Next(Message(e), List(e)) {
////   case message {
////     // For the `Shutdown` message we return the `actor.Stop` value, which causes
////     // the actor to discard any remaining messages and stop.
////     Shutdown -> actor.Stop(process.Normal)
//// 
////     // For the `Push` message we add the new element to the stack and return
////     // `actor.continue` with this new stack, causing the actor to process any
////     // queued messages or wait for more.
////     Push(value) -> {
////       let new_state = [value, ..stack]
////       actor.continue(new_state)
////     }
//// 
////     // For the `Pop` message we attempt to remove an element from the stack,
////     // sending it or an error back to the caller, before continuing.
////     Pop(client) ->
////       case stack {
////         [] -> {
////           // When the stack is empty we can't pop an element, so we send an
////           // error back.
////           process.send(client, Error(Nil))
////           actor.continue([])
////         }
//// 
////         [first, ..rest] -> {
////           // Otherwise we send the first element back and use the remaining
////           // elements as the new state.
////           process.send(client, Ok(first))
////           actor.continue(rest)
////         }
////       }
////   }
